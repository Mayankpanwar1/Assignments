    " The levels of measurement are a classification system for data that describes the amount of information that can be inferred from the values of a variable. There are four levels of measurement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal: The nominal level of measurement is the most basic level. It only allows you to classify data into categories that are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. For example, the variable \"gender\" can be measured at the nominal level, with the categories \"male\" and \"female.\"\n",
    "Ordinal: The ordinal level of measurement allows you to rank data in order, but it does not allow you to make inferences about the size of the difference between any two values. For example, the variable \"grade\" can be measured at the ordinal level, with the categories \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" \"D,\" and \"F.\"\n",
    "Interval: The interval level of measurement allows you to rank data in order and to make inferences about the size of the difference between any two values. However, it does not have a true zero point. For example, the variable \"temperature\" can be measured at the interval level, with the values \"10 degrees Celsius,\" \"20 degrees Celsius,\" and so on.\n",
    "Ratio: The ratio level of measurement is the most complex level of measurement. It allows you to rank data in order, to make inferences about the size of the difference between any two values, and to have a true zero point. For example, the variable \"height\" can be measured at the ratio level, with the values \"1 meter,\" \"2 meters,\" and so on."
